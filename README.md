# JobSequence
The Java code takes in input Job values in the following format:

a => b

The input values can be typed in directly or can be read through a text file.

Each Job is then placed in a Linked List Node. Following this, a seperate method is called, which attaches the dependencies of each of the nodes. 

The final result is then derived, where Job sequence is displayed, depending on the dependency of each Job.
